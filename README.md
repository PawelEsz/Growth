# Growth
My own ASP.NET MVC application.
It created to learn ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and common web frameworks (SignalR, Angular etc.)
I planned to expand application about new function (log/reg system, blog/article system, communicator and other interesting ideas that come to my head) using web frameworks.
